# Prettier

ESLint is really amazing tool that allow you to enforce coding patterns among your teams. This has many benefits, like outputting better and more consistent code, getting rid of useless diffs in commits like newlines, indentation among many others.

But over time, this can prove to be a bit of a pesky among the developers of a team, who find it an extra load to manually add semicolons, newlines, indentations, etc just to conform to the lint rules. 

This is where a code formatting tool like Prettier comes in to help you reduce these syntax mistakes and save a lot of time to focus on what really matters.

Prettier can be easily configured to automatically format your code according to some specified rules.
